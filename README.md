# 🌍 World Population Data Extractor

## 📝 Project Overview

This project is a **lightweight Python utility** for extracting and filtering world population data from a CSV dataset. It streamlines the process of working with raw population data, letting you focus on the countries and information that matter most to you.

## 🚀 What’s Implemented

- **CSV Data Processing** 📑  
  Reads a CSV file containing global population statistics.

- **Data Filtering** 🔍  
  Extracts specific columns or countries from the dataset based on criteria in the script.

- **Simple & Customizable** ⚙️  
  The script is designed to be clear and easy to modify for different filtering needs (change country lists, columns, etc.).

## 🎮 How It Works

1. **Reads the Dataset**: Loads population data from `world_population.csv`.
2. **Filters the Data**: Selects only the countries or columns you want (for example, focusing on a handful of countries or years).

Perfect for anyone needing a quick way to extract population subsets from a large CSV—without any extra dependencies or fuss! 🌎✨
